  Hi there, my name is Seoyun!
  </p>

  <p>
  I was born in Seoul, South Korea and moved to the US when I was six.
  My family found a pleasant suburban house in Mill Creek, Washington and we have been living there ever since.
  Fortunately, all the schools I attended were near my house.
  Mill Creek Elementary School, Heatherwood Middle School, and Henry M. Jackson High School, the schools I have/are attending, are all a short drive away from where I live.
  </p>

  <p>
  Currently, I am a senior at Jackson High School.
  It’s been a good three years, but I’m especially excited for senior year.
  I’ve slowly become involved in lots of activities to keep me busy this upcoming year.
  I participate in my school’s swim team and tennis team. I am also in NHS and TSA.
  </p>

  <p>
  I like to do a lot of things in my free time, but I especially like to go hiking and camping;
  if it’s anything related to nature and the outdoors, I’m down to do it.
  My favorite hiking spots are Wallace Falls and Heather Lake.
  Two of my good friends and I have a hiking group, and we call ourselves the Sherpals.
  I also love taking pictures, growing plants, going thrift shopping, and volunteering.
  I volunteer at my local animal shelter every weekend and it’s my favorite thing ever!
